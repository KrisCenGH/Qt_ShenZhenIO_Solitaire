The total number of lines of code in the header and source files is approximately 1200 lines.

Known issues: 1. When 'New Game' is executed multiple times, the program occasionally crashes for unknown reasons. 2. The Z value of the three QPushButtons cannot be set lower than the cards, causing the buttons to hover above the cards when they are moved over them. The author has searched for a solution multiple times without success.

Note: All game resource files are from the SHENZHENIO game folder.Additionally, cards may have different drawing effects on different computers.
